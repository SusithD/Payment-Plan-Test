                  If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal

                  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO
                  SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced

                  Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA's

                  Rules"), both of which are available at the American Arbitration

                  arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and,
                  where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration
                  may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by
                  phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but
                  need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either
                  Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be
                  challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise
                  required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration
                  will take place in California. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
                  Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings
                  pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on
                  the award entered by the arbitrator.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration,
                  the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal
                  courts located in California, and the Parties hereby consent to, and
                  waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non
                  conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and
                  federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on
                  Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer
                  Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way
                  to the Services be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of
                  action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable,
                  then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within
                  that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and
                  such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction
                  within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree
                  to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

                <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-900">Restrictions</h4>
                <p>
                  The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
                  between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
                  (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there
                  is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
                  class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there
                  is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
                  representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other
                  persons.
                </p>
                
                <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-900">Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h4>
                <p>
                  The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
                  above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration:
                  (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the
                  validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any
                  Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
                  invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for
                  injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or
                  unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute
                  falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
                  unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
                  jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the
                  Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
